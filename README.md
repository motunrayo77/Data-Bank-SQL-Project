 Data Analysis Project: SQL Challenge Solution  

Welcome to my SQL data analysis project! This repository contains my work solving key analytical challenges using SQL, with a focus on real-world data insights.


 About the Data  

The data for this project is sourced from Case Study #4: Data Bank in the [8-Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-4/).  

The dataset represents customer transactions and activities for a fictional financial service called "Data Bank", which offers products like deposits, withdrawals, and purchases. The data is structured across the following tables:  

- regions: Contains details about regions where customers are located.  
- customer_nodes: Provides customer location history based on data usage.  
- customer_transactions: Includes all transactions made by customers, such as deposits, withdrawals, and purchases.  

This dataset provides an excellent opportunity to explore customer financial behavior, transaction patterns, and movement across locations.

 Project Overview  

This project focuses on solving analytical questions related to the dataset. Specifically, I explored customer behavior trends, transaction patterns, and key performance metrics for Data Bank.  

The project answers critical business questions to provide insights into customer activity and regional performance, using SQL as the primary tool for querying and analysis.  

Tools Used  

- SQL: The analysis was performed using PostgreSQL.  
- Data Exploration and Cleaning: Leveraged SQL functions for aggregating, filtering, and structuring data for meaningful insights.  

How to Use This Repository  

1. SQL Queries: The repository contains '.sql' files with the solutions to the analysis tasks. These queries are modular and can be run directly in your SQL environment.  
2. Data : Load the raw dataset from the Data_bank.sql file.

 Key Learnings  

This project demonstrates the use of:  
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for breaking down complex queries.  
- Window functions to analyze trends (e.g., calculating moving averages, percentages).  
- Aggregations and filters to explore customer-level metrics.  
- Date and time functions to group data and calculate metrics over time.
